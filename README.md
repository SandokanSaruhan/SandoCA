**SandoCA** is a web application that replicates the core functionalities of Amazon, including user registration, product listings, and a shopping cart. In this improved version, additional features like an admin panel, brand and category management, and advanced product search capabilities have been added.

## Installation

To get started, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your web server.

2. Make sure you have a MySQL database ready for use. You can import the initial database structure from the `db.sql` file included in this repository.

3. Update the database connection settings in the `dbconnect.php` file to match your database credentials.

4. Ensure that the directory paths in `dbconnect.php` are correctly set for your server environment.

5. Navigate to the application's URL in your web browser to start using **SandoCA**.

## Database Configuration

The application uses MySQL as its database. You can find the initial database structure in the `db.sql` file. To import it, use the following command:

```sql
mysql -u your_username -p your_database_name < db.sql

```

## Admin User Setup
To set up an admin user, follow these steps:

Log in to the application using the default admin credentials (if not already changed by the previous developer):

Username: admin
Password: admin
After logging in, you can navigate to the admin panel.

Create a new admin user or modify the existing admin user to secure your application.

## Customization
You can further customize SandoCA to suit your specific needs. You can modify the application's appearance, add new features, or extend its functionality as necessary.

## Features
- User Roles: The application has user roles, including admin and normal users.
- Admin Panel: Admins have access to the admin panel, where they can manage brands, categories, and users.
- Advanced Search: Users can search for products based on popularity, lowest price, and price range.
